          I work for one of Thincode's client in the US, as an added member to their software
          development team. Between my daily activities, I develop API endpoints, UIs for their main
          application, some of them using VueJS. I also coordinate a team that migrates an app from
          Rails 1 to 5, write tests, and function as a communication bridge between Thincode and its
          client's dev team.

        <p>
          I was part of a team that built a web application test suite using Ruby tools like RSpec,
          Capybara and Cucumber. This suite was required by one of Thincode's client in the US. After
          my work in this position, I got promoted to Ruby on Rails developer in one of the client's
          dev teams.

        <h6>September 2016 - December 2016</h6>

        <p>
          I did an academic stay in Canada taking courses on programming, system maintenance, management and philosophy of IT.
          It was an improvment to my English skills, being in a fully inmersive environment, making it a life changing experience.
          The main thing I learnt was to be eager to overcome myself and reach out of my comfort zone.
